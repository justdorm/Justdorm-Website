        <p id="streampar">Census is an artwork that builds itself through its audience. At its center is a slowly rotating pie chart, which begins as a blank canvas and gradually fills with unique textures, one for each viewer. Over the course of the exhibition, this accumulation transforms the work into both an archive and a portrait of the event itself. By its conclusion, “Census” captures not data but presence, recording the community through the simple act of participation.</p>

    <p id="streampar">Census premiered at the SVA Flatiron Gallery for the Fall 2025 show "Technological Perseverance." It was developed in TouchDesigner, using a depth camera to detect when a viewer is in front of the piece. A glow indicates that their presence is being recorded. Behind the scenes, there is a table for data storage (how long a viewer is present and the angle which the slice should originate from), and replicators which reference this data for the pie chart slices themselves. A random texture from a texture library is chosen for each new viewer and is blended with previous slices in case of overlap. <br>  </p>
